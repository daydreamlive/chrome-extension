### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prepare Your Environment**

   - Have test video conferencing accounts ready

2. **Capture Screenshots**
   - Take screenshots at least 1280x800
   - Capture more than you need (you can select the best ones)
   - Take multiple shots of each scenario
   - Ensure consistent lighting and quality

3. **Edit Screenshots**
   - Resize to exactly 1280x800 pixels
   - Crop to show relevant content
   - Add subtle annotations if needed
   - Blur any personal information
   - Ensure text is readable at all sizes

4. **Add Annotations (Optional)**
   - Use arrows to highlight features

5. **Optimize Files**
   - Save as PNG for UI screenshots (better quality)
